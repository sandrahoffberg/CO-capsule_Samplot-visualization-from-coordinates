description: "A command line tool for interactive, rapid, multi-sample structural
  variant visualization. This capsule is best suited as a standalone capsule (not
  run in a pipeline).  It will plot a single genomic region of interest, and the App
  Panel allows the user to customize the figures produced.  \n\nhttps://github.com/ryanlayer/samplot"
